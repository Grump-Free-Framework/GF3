# Grump-Free-Framework
> Fork of Fat-Free-Framework 3.6 with included MVC project structure with basic automated routing, UIKit 3, and GrumpyPDO 1.4, Drag & Drop ready to reduce grumpiness.

GF3 is a framework based on Fat-Free-Framework, which is mostly known for allowing you to structure your projects however you want, but this fork has a MVC structure baked into it. This is basically a skeleton project that may be used to rapidly create MVC model websites.

Currently, GF3 comes with a few core features:
- Fat-Free-Framework version 3.6
- A custom MVC system structure
- Stock with UIKIT 3, but can easily be changed.
- Complex template structure with separate files for header, navbar, and footer code
- GrumpyPDO 1.4 for easy and secure MySQL database management

## Installation

Drag & Drop Ready. Simply download the repository as a zip file and unpack it onto an apache server, and then rename the `.htaccess.apache` file to `.htaccess`

For nginx, lighttpd, IIS, check out the documentation at [https://fatfreeframework.com/3.6/routing-engine#SampleApacheConfiguration](fatfreeframework.com) for information on how to set up the project.
