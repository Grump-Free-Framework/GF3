<h1>Grump-Free-Framework</h1>
<p>
	GF3 is a framework based on Fat-Free-Framework, which is mostly known for allowing you to structure your projects however you want, but this fork has a MVC structure baked into it. This is basically a skeleton project that may be used to rapidly create MVC model websites.
